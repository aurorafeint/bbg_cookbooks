Blue Box Group, LLC Public Cookbooks for Chef
=============================================

Blue Box has published our public cookbooks for Chef in this repository; we do active
maintenance and bug fixes on this repository, so make sure to check in every
now and then to make sure that you have the latest fixes/cookbooks from this
repository.

This Chef cookbooks repository is meant for CentOS / RHEL systems.  If you're
using anything other than Chef + CentOS / RHEL, things may break; we will
likely generalize the recipes for use on Debian/Ubuntu systems, but for now,
make sure you're using these Chef cookbooks with CentOS / RHEL systems only.

If you have any bugs that you've uncovered in any of these recipes, please let
us know through the "Issues" page in GitHub.

Contributing
------------
We're happy to accept pull requests for cookbooks that are ready to be shared with
the general public.  Please ensure that all submissions are generic enough to be
useful to a general audience.
